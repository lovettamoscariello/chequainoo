It's happened twice while I've been actively using the laptop (either just scrolling through Facebook or Reddit, nothing else), and there have been 3 times where my laptop has reset. I was watching a tv show in Chrome and all of a sudden I got an BSOD, however it was in orange. I've never seen this before so I wasn't thinking clearly and didn't pickup any of the important text or QR code and had to shut my laptop off.

It's happened 2-5 times in the last two weeks. It's happened twice while I've been actively using the laptop (either just scrolling through Facebook or Reddit, nothing else), and there have been 3 times where my laptop has reset itself while I've left my room for a few minutes (and it wasn't doing an update). I've looked for a solution online but everything I've seen has to do with a bad Synaptics driver I know this is a /r/techsupport question but it's very specifically WX. I upgraded from Windows 7 on an Acer Aspire 8943G laptop. The drivers haven't been update since 2010 so no Windows 10 driver for me. I seem to lose a lot of functionality with the standard-not-OEM-driver from Synaptics (it has a button for controlling playback etc in the middle for example which is deactivated).

Is there a way to do this? I know you can enable/disable certain driver options via the registry So just as the title says I am getting an error when Windows updates is trying to install the Synaptics touchpad driver for my Dell 5000 series laptop.
