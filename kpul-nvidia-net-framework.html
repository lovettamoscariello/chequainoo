                            <p> Alright, this is my last hope. I wanted to re-install the game today and try out what I've missed. However, I keep encountering the dreaded C7 error. I've read just about every post on the internet regarding it and tried everything. Finally, I completely uninstalled my video drivers and the game launched. However, it obviously runs horribly and I can't play like that. NVIDIA lists legacy drivers only back to November 2018 and that one doesn't work either. My dxdiag is here (https://hastebin. Maybe someone can help me with this one. I'm trying to install this app from nvidia which installed fine about a week ago, but I forgot to uninstall it prior to running Display Driver Uninstall and somehow it got caught up in that wipe. Now when I go to install it, it claims NET 4 isn't installed, but the thing is, every other nvidia installer works fine (driver, geforce experience) and all games that require net run fine too. It's like this LEDVisualizer installer is erroneously not seeing. I purchased a new Laptop after my previous lost the ability to run FFXIV. After installing and running FFXIV which it does normal, I get this error message when I exit the game. I have tried running the game in full screen and windows mode, yet the error still occurs. Can anyone instruct me how to correct this issue? (I have attached an image with the Error pop up.) My Specs: Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8300H CPU @ 2.30GHz 2.30GHz Installed Memory (RAM): 8.00 GB (7.86 GB usable) System. 
vcredist,nvidia,.net framework ,visual c++ and few things that i forgot names are updated before this error i was had api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll  i download and paste then it turned to this -.- HELP ME!!?! I will look to here until fix so you even reply after 5 years. The bar is right under the word "installing". It's not frozen because the little white beam is still going across it, and the slides are changing. I'm on Windows 7 trying Hey there, sorry for the long title. So I recently (1 hour ago) ran a clean install of windows 7 Home Premium (on my tabletop PC) due to getting so many wow64win.dll errors I could run anything anymore. As the idiot I am I forgot to do a backup of various drivers for my graphics card, network adapter and so on. I eventually got my network connection back by transfering downloaded drivers from my laptop. I then downloaded the relevant drivers for my Gforce graphics card and started installing. My profits have more than halfed the last 2 weeks. Whats going on? I am running 7x GTX 1060 3GB and only mining 0.0005 BTC / day, where as before I was mining up towards 0.0012 BTC / day. Yes alt coins dropped compared to BTC, but still this is redicolous. SECONDLY: Why the fuck does nicehash Nvidia version not have Dagger on it? I HAVE TO MANUALLY SWITCH to the AMD version everytime Ethereum is the most profitable to mine. Whats the point of autoswitching if your Nvidia miner doesn't Homepage: https://www.paladins.com Steam Store: Enter a fantasy world of ancient technology in Paladins, a team-based shooter with strategy elements and deep character customization.

My computer was running fine up until yesterday. I hadn't played games that much this but I finally sat down to play some World of Tanks. I played one match which ran perfectly fine. Someone called for my attention and I went away from my PC. When I came back my second monitor was a light blue and my main monitor was in standby mode like it was getting no signal. I restarted my pc and everything booted up fine but I had to good somewhere and just left it. When I get home like 12 hours later. I downloaded the demo for Batman: Arkham Asylum a few days ago and every time I try to start up the game, I get this ( error message. I have Windows 8 on my computer, it is not a dedicated gaming computer (for one, I can't afford one, and two, I can't get the idea past my parents), and I have tried every solution I could So in sequence 2, memory 1: "Imprisoned" I keep encountering a bug/glitch where Pierre slides into the wall during your escape and descends into the abyss instead of kicking it open. Anybody have any idea what I can do to fix this? Here is a screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/RhuUF2n.jpg?1. Just recently my laptop ( Specs ( Alt Specs with Speccy ( has been acting weirdly during games, however it doesn't seem like a problem revolving around a games settings because it is happening in multiple games so i assume its something wrong with my computer. Problem : During games my performance will drop, normally averaging 120 frames, dropping to 20, then back to 120, and back down. happening from 10-20 second. Hello Agents, amp#x200B; I, like so many others, have been experiencing ludicrous amounts of game crashes in both DX11 and DX12 since the first patch a week into launch. I have spent the past 2 weeks or so trying every suggested fix here and on the forums to no avail and even got so far into the weeds that I had to format and start over twice due to completely destabilizing my PC. Considering I have roughly 15 years of experience in building and working on computers, you can imagine 
Just looking for some insight here as I'm a little lost on how this happened or why this worked. In short, the last few weeks my main PC that's 7 years old has exhibited many blue screens, though almost entirely while gaming. Memtest said RAM was OK. I'm on an old i5-3570k so I downloaded Intel's CPU diagnostic software. Ran just fine. Checked SSD life and it's quite healthy. I didn't know how to test the GPU, but I figured that wouldn't be it as games that would alternate between crashing. I've had over a dozen bulbs now for over 2 years. I've been waiting the whole time for a app that matches screen color to bulbs on my PC. Yes, yes I know MaxLifx, but that's a side project by someone who hasn't done much with it in months and is based on a old NET Framework. I have a feeling I may have just outgrown LIFX's stagnant feature set. I'd like to do more with my lights. This is sort of an open letter I suppose to see if we'll ever see even half the feature parity to Hue? Is there. I'm having trouble with these two - are there known compatibility issues between them? I'm using Optifine 1.12.2, and the game tends to crash when loading into a world. Here's the crash report: \---- Minecraft Crash Report ---- amp#x200B; WARNING: coremods are present: MalisisCorePlugin (malisiscore-1.12.2-6.4.0.jar) Inventory Tweaks Coremod (InventoryTweaks-1.63.jar) DynamicSurroundingsCore (DynamicSurroundings-1.12.2-3.4.9.15.jar) ForgelinPlugin (Forgelin-1.7.4.jar) CTMCore. I recently installed the Intel DCH Graphic Driver version 26.xxxx on my laptop with integrated Intel UHD 620 and a dedicated Nvidia MX150. I was previously using an outdated Intel graphics driver with the Intel Graphics Control Panel. amp#x200B; With these new drivers, you now need IGCC to edit the different display settings and such but the problem is that it isn't opening at all. When I click on it in the Start Menu the window opens up but then closes after 1-2 seconds. amp#x200B;. I want to see if anyone else in encountering this issue. I used to play Dauntless often, but have not played since shortly after repeaters were released into the game. amp#x200B; I updated recently, but now when I launch the game I cannot play. The game launches, I see the intro cinematic for Phoenix Labs, and then I get this screen with a dialogue explaining the game, like a message from the devs. When I click OK, the OK button changes colors, there's some sparkle effects, and NOTHING. Currently running MetaTrade 4 on Bionic Beaver through WINE. Seems to run okay. Gets a little chunky at times when I'm pushing it a bit. I'll post my basic hardware specs at the bottom, but they shouldn't be the issue. I suppose WINE is bottlenecking my performance somehow; more specifically: I'm trying to run a plugin for MT4 called Soft4FX. The plugin seems to boot up fine, but once I actually ask it to start doing something (likely resource intensive), it locks up within about 5-10 seconds. 
I just got my new PC setup, it's got some high end components and I was really excited to get Skyrim installed and then eventually get some good quality mods in place for a fresh playthrough. Unfortunately, I can't even get the base game to launch! When I click "Play Game," it pops up a little window "Installing .NET framework," then the Skyrim launcher appears. It tells me it does not recognize my video card (nVidia GeForce RTX 2080), and irregardless if I put it on low or Ultra settings Hello everyone! I’m relatively new to the field of Deep Learning, but am itching to learn more. I have academic background in statistical theory with a focus on data science, but have also been taking some Deep Learning classes through Coursera (Andrew Ng’s deep learning specialization). I just have a few questions that I wanted to get some input on from this community: 1) I am very well versed in R for most of the analytical things that I do, though I do know a little bit of Python (the course. NVTrayprovides some extra quality tweaks that both the default NVIDIA tray icon and control panel are lacking. I especially wanted to be able to select. 
Nvidia wants to extend the success of the GPU beyond graphics and deep learning to the full data science experience. Open source Python library </p>
