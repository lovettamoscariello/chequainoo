                            <p> Just thought I'd let you guys know. It negates the actual filling phials bit, but works as a very fast GP. Accidentally found this when Ukanlos began to dig beside me. This might be total bullshit, so I'll have to test, but if not this is a neat discovery, since I haven't seen anyone talk about. Hi! I have an X220, Device Manager says it has a Sierra Wireless MC8355. Does this mean I have access to GPS location in Windows 10? Does this work without having an active 3G connection (I'm not signed up with a provider)? If so, how would I figure out if Windows 10 is using the GPS for location and not just the location via wifi/IP? Thanks.

I’ve reinstalled fsx after years of not playing and before the gps would just pop up with the shortcut key, but now all it does a show the outlining of the gps window. Is there a fix for this?

Hi all! I have finally finished my satellite tracking app after a lot of time and effort (and losing motivation in the proccess with the Windows Mobile shutdown). You can check it here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/sattracker/9p5wxj1v0xwn (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/sattracker/9p5wxj1v0xwn) There are a lot of functionalities missing like live tile, reminders, filtering by name. But I prefered to release it like it's now than don't release it at all. I hope the few people interes. New Timestamp/ iPod Photos: https://imgur.com/a/h3umApL Old/better Photos:: https://imgur.com/a/4gfyuau Not looking for any trades. iPod Classic 7th Gen 160GB (better iPod photos here: https://imgur.com/a/1zbscZn) I refurbed this, full new front amp back casing, along with a brand new battery - played for 30+ hours straight at 40% volume. I sold it on ebay originally, but the buyer said it gave him an error once he tried loading more than ~1300 songs Does anyone have any experience using the Foreflight Sentry ADS-B? I've been looking into purchasing one since it does almost everything a Stratus does, but cheaper, but after reading some really detailed bad reviews, I'm wondering what people here think of it. Common problems are low accuracy and unable to find towers/GPS. Hey, I have a pretty quick homework assignment that I'm stuck on. All help is appreciated, this is due tomorrow and I can't figure it out. I need to make a program that let's a user sign up, log in, browse a marketplace, add items to a cart, keep a wishlist, make a secure payment, keep track of purchases, and stream purchased videos. These needs to be a website that users can access on their phones. I'm a little stuck on what to do, here's the code I have so far: print('hello world'). 
Has anyone experienced this issue before. Hi! I don't know if this is the right place to ask, but I'm completely stumped: A rather tech-savvy user at a remote office got his hands on a Latitude 12 Rugged 7202 tablet for field work. It's equipped with assembly no. 338-BHHP: "Intel Core M-5Y71 Processor with 8GB Memory and Dedicated GPS" which I assume is the mainboard with a soldered CPU and RAM as well as a dedicated GPS card as the assembly includes a bracket (part no.: 23T5F, 4FPFC and 965WR). The device does not have a WWAN card. I've had a Personal CellSpot in my house for about 2-3 years now and have been having trouble receiving calls, voicemails, and MMS messages at home for about a year. I've spoken with T-Mobile customer support about the issue and they've insinuated that my phones (all unlocked Moto Gs) are the problem and suggest I get proper T-Mobile phones. But here's the thing, my phones work everywhere else (signal allowing) perfectly. I get that they want me to pay them for brand-new phones but there's. Hey everyone - my main laptop needs a new hard drive, but it's also a big 17" gaming laptop. I'm considering picking up a Chromebook for light use along with the new laptop hard drive for heavier gaming, processing, etc. I am looking at a refurbished R11 w/ a 3160 processor. It's definitely budget, but I'm hoping it'll accomplish what I need it for. My main uses: I ride bikes and use a website called RidewithGPS.com to make a route, save it as a gpx file, and move that file to my GPS device. I installed magisk and trying to smali pacthed but need deodex. The procedure of deodex is difficult for me. Thus i decided try on tinfoil can work or not. Thanks. Why do I have to do like 4 to 6 swipes/clicks outside of the map screen or more just to a)mute or unmute audio and b)THEN as a SEPARATE ACTION go back in to change the audio source (Bluetooth, phone speaker, etc)? Aside from consistent issues with GPS lately, rerouting me last minute to terrible routes, etc., I am honestly using Waze less and less in lieu of Google Maps - where at least I can hit one little audio icon on the main navigation screen if I want to change the audio. olympus a-gps utility 是一款软件应用程序，可用于下载最新的a-gps数据，以更快地进行定位并将其写入支持a-gps的olympus数码相机中。.
