                            <p> Hi all, I hope this is the right place to ask this. So I have some basic kit of various ages I've picked up over the years. I'm working with a Line 6 amp of some description, a Zoom multi FX box, a Behringer mini mixing desk and a little Fostex 8 track recorder. My question is, what's the best way to wire this up? At the moment I'm going: Guitar-gtFX box-gtamp-gtmixing desk-gt8track. Should the guitar be going through the FX box and then into the amp, which I have set to clean Right, so the setup I did was: -Guitar FX Box 3 -Virtual Cable -Rocksmith cable. In the program, I set the input as my guitar, the output as Virtual cable IN, so I could add distortion to the guitar. I was testing it out with a friend on Discord, I set the Virtual cable output as the recording device on Discord. The guitar transmits to FX Box, Fxbox transmits to discord, they could hear it without any problems, but, I wanted to listen to this as well, however, when I click on "hear this device. I have this situation frequently: I get a riff idea and want to record it to my MacBook Air or iPhone while talking it out. Ideally I could record stereo from the keyboard (or guitar FX box) with a mono mic simultaneously. This could also be used for reviewing new equipment on YouTube. What is the most portable way to get this done with direct stereo input from the instrument and mic at the same time? Money is pretty much no object. Small is more important than cheap because I would So with so many engineering students here, I bet we've all done a lot of cool stuff. Whether for classes, internship, or fun, what's the coolest thing you've done/built with engineering? I spent last semester building an iPad app that acted as a Guitar FX Box, complete with 10-band equalizer, Flanger, Tremolo, Vibrato, Distortion, a bunch of other effects, and a pretty interesting visualizer. I also finished building a basic OCR system for russian characters two weeks ago. That was pretty. Hey There i've been playing Bass for 1 year and 3 Months. I now want to experiment with lots of effects ( Budget of about 250$). So i found the Boss GT-1B. Is this Multi FX Pedal worth the Price. I will use it mainly at home and at very small gigs. Thx everyone. I have this situation frequently: I get a riff idea and want to record it to my MacBook Air or iPhone while talking it out.

Small is more important than cheap because I would like this to go into the backpack with me when I travel. Sorry 
15 years ago I got to play with a studio protools HD system, and ever since I've been dreaming of that experience. Endless plugins with rich, high quality effects that I could use with my guitar with almost no latency. My experience at home was that home recording with fx plugins are low quality and high latency. Now it's been about 8 years, and things have changed, but how much? I'm considering buying: 1) A thunderbolt interface (Zoom, about 0) 2) A Pro-tools HD card (,500?). I recently started using the dirt channel of my amp again. Since I don't like my Reverb and Delay in front of it, I'd like to use the FX Loop. Problem is, that there's not much space on my board. So I either have to get some longer angled cables that would start or end somewhere in the middle of my board or something else. That something else I imagine would be a box that's located somewhere on the margin of my board or maybe even below (with the jacks pointing outwards of course). It should. Anyone interested in doing a blind swap? I'll ship a pedal worth at least 0 on Reverb Price Guide, you do the same?

My board ( https://i.imgur.com/vOJK86B.jpg) In an effort to get more out of my ES-8, I started trying out more pedals with MIDI last year. Chase Bliss pedals work pretty well in this regard, and I’ve got them all synced up (Except Brothers, I use one setting most of the time to keep it consistent). I reassigned the bank knobs to tap tempo and that syncs all the rates easily. On a mildly infuriating note, the tempo LED on Thermae flashes opposite everything else. Right now I don’t I need some advice on a good multi effects processor for guitar. Been playing guitar for well over 20 years. But honestly don’t have a ton of experience with multi effects processors. I’m used to using individual pedals and tweaking them as I need to. But for the past couple years I’ve been playing lead guitar for a church worship team. And my needs have kind of evolved. Here’s what I’m wanting (I don’t even know if something like this even exists) 1. Create multiple custom settings OK, I still play Rocksmith too. I started when the PC version first came out in October 2012, playing along to slowly rolling single notes of Satisfaction and was immediately hooked. 6 1/2 years later I find myself playing mostly outside the game these days, and I thought I'd share the rig I've settled on as I look to grow my skills outside the game in case anyone finds it useful. 1) Monoprice Stage Right (https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=611815) 15w tube amp. I never thought No matter how I record my guitar the recorded sound always comes back muddy and sounds as if it’s overloading the channel, even if I record at a low volume. I’ve tried both A) plugging my guitar (Jackson Monarkh, EMG pickups) into my amp (Line 6 Spider) and through my DI box (Focusrite Scarlett) and B) Recording directly into my DI and using various filters/FX through reaper. Any tips on recording an aggressive sound that doesn’t sound messy I feel like the Boss SY300 gets marketed primarily as a guitar synth, which, makes sense because that is its unique feature, and it does it very, very well. However, it's still not something you'd use every day. However, this thing is an incredible multi-fx unit!!! Not only does it have the works, but also some fun effects, like the Slicer and the Slow Gear. Every preset can be equipped four moveable effects unit and there's an FX loop, MIDI in/out as well as an expression out. Everything
